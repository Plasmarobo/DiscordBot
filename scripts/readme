Install discord_bot as a service (by placing in /etc/init.d)

Install checkbot.sh in /usr/bin/ or anyother location. Ensure this location is in PATH.
Add a crontab entry with crontab -e 
Add a line to crontab: */5 * * * * <path to>/checkbot.sh

This should keep the server alive if it is installed as a service.
